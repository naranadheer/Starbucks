# Starbucks
Starbucks Rewards Capstone Project

Project Background:
Starbucks is a coffee company which provides rewards to certain customers to their mobile app.
Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be
merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get
one free).
Problem Statement:
The aim of this project is to identify whether an offer provided by Starbucks is reaching the
target audience and classify offers to complete the transaction.

## Software and Python Libraries Used


Python Data Analysis Library

Numpy

Matplotlib

seaborn: Statistical Data Visualization

Miscellaneous operating system interfaces

scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python


Problem Statement<br>

The goal of the project is to identify whether customers will respond to the offer given transaction,demographic and offer data.
The steps to solve the challenge is:
Explore all the given data.
Preprocess and visualize data.
Data modelling
Training on different algorithms
Evaluating the metrics and choosing a better performing model.


Results<br>

The benchmark was achieved by using AdaBoostClassifier which is 0.97 and I believe there is no room for improvement and it may be overfitting.
The metrics used is F1 score because it evaluated good accuracy by leveraging precision and recall in classification problems.



Improvements:<br>

Support vector classifiers have large Time complexity which might give better accuracy,but avoided due to resource constraint.
The result which may overfit problem better feature engineering ang hyperparameter may result in great accuracy.
