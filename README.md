Starbucks__Rewards_Capstone_Project

Project Background:
Starbucks is a coffee company which provides rewards to certain customers to their mobile app.
Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be
merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get
one free).
Problem Statement:
The aim of this project is to identify whether an offer provided by Starbucks is reaching the
target audience and classify offers to complete the transaction.
